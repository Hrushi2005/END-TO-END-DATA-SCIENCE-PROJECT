This code builds a pipeline to predict the risk of heart disease using a Random Forest model and deploys it as a web application using Flask. The machine learning workflow involves reading a dataset (heart.csv), selecting specific features (age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol), and splitting the data into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Classifier is trained, achieving accuracy measured on the test set. The trained model is saved in a .pkl file using the pickle library.

The Flask application provides a user-friendly interface for prediction. A simple HTML form collects patient data such as name, age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. On submission, the model predicts whether the patient is at risk of a heart attack. If the blood pressure is critically low (â‰¤60), additional warnings are displayed. The app runs locally or in Google Colab via flask_ngrok, demonstrating an end-to-end machine learning deployment process.
